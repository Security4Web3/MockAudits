## Key Deliverables

1. **Research Documentation**
   - Detailed analysis of Uniswap V3 protocol architecture
   - Comprehensive overview of DeFi vulnerabilities with Uniswap focus

2. **Custom Security Tests**
   - Reentrancy attack tests
   - Oracle manipulation tests
   - Flash loan attack tests
   - Front-running and MEV tests

3. **Mock Attack Contracts**
   - Specialized contracts that simulate various attack vectors
   - Each contract includes detailed comments explaining the attack mechanism

4. **Documentation**
   - Detailed test execution instructions
   - Comprehensive audit report with findings and recommendations

## Getting Started

To run the security tests, please follow the instructions in `test-execution-instructions.md`. This document provides step-by-step guidance for setting up the environment and executing the tests.

## Audit Report

The `audit-report.md` file contains a comprehensive security assessment of the Uniswap V3 protocol, including:

- Executive summary
- Detailed findings for each vulnerability type
- Risk assessment
- Recommendations for protocol developers, users, and integrators

## Security Vulnerabilities Tested

The audit covers the following security aspects:

1. **Reentrancy Protection**
   - Tests for reentrancy vulnerabilities in flash loans, swaps, and liquidity provision

2. **Oracle Manipulation Resistance**
   - Tests for price oracle manipulation through large swaps and flash loans
   - Verification of TWAP oracle resistance to manipulation

3. **Flash Loan Security**
   - Tests for proper flash loan repayment enforcement
   - Attempts to exploit flash loans to drain pool reserves

4. **Front-Running and MEV Protection**
   - Tests for sandwich attack resistance
   - Verification of slippage protection effectiveness
   - MEV extraction limitation tests

## Conclusion

This security audit provides a comprehensive assessment of the Uniswap V3 protocol's security posture. The custom tests developed during this audit can be used for ongoing security validation as the protocol evolves.

While the protocol demonstrates robust security measures against common DeFi vulnerabilities, we recommend ongoing vigilance and regular security reviews as the DeFi ecosystem continues to evolve.
