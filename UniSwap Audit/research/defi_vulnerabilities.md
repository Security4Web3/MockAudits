# Common DeFi Security Vulnerabilities with Focus on Uniswap

## 1. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
Smart contracts are the foundation of DeFi protocols like Uniswap. Flaws in their code can lead to catastrophic exploits.

### Key Vulnerabilities:
- **Reentrancy Attacks**: When a function can be interrupted before it completes, allowing multiple withdrawals
- **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Mathematical operations that exceed variable size limits
- **Access Control Issues**: Improper permission management allowing unauthorized actions
- **Logic Errors**: Flawed business logic that can be exploited

### Uniswap-Specific Concerns:
- Complex pool mathematics in Uniswap V3 increases the attack surface
- Concentrated liquidity positions require careful validation
- Fee calculation errors could lead to economic exploits

## 2. Oracle Manipulation Attacks
Oracles provide price data to DeFi protocols. Manipulating these price feeds can create arbitrage opportunities.

### Attack Mechanism:
- Attackers use flash loans to temporarily manipulate prices in liquidity pools
- These manipulated pools are used by oracles to determine asset values
- DeFi protocols using these oracles make decisions based on incorrect prices
- Attackers profit from the resulting arbitrage opportunities

### Uniswap-Specific Concerns:
- Uniswap pools are often used as price oracles by other protocols
- Low liquidity pools are especially vulnerable to price manipulation
- Uniswap's TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) mechanism helps mitigate some attacks but introduces latency

## 3. Flash Loan Attacks
Flash loans allow borrowing large amounts without collateral, as long as the loan is repaid within the same transaction.

### Attack Mechanism:
- Borrow substantial funds via flash loan
- Use borrowed funds to manipulate market prices or exploit vulnerabilities
- Extract profit from the manipulation
- Repay the flash loan in the same transaction

### Uniswap-Specific Concerns:
- Flash loans can be used to manipulate Uniswap pool prices
- Attackers can create artificial arbitrage opportunities
- Potential for sandwich attacks (front-running and back-running transactions)

## 4. Front-Running
Front-running occurs when attackers observe pending transactions and submit their own with higher gas fees to get priority.

### Attack Mechanism:
- Monitor mempool for profitable transactions
- Submit similar transaction with higher gas fee
- Execute transaction before the original
- Profit from the price impact

### Uniswap-Specific Concerns:
- Particularly prevalent in Uniswap and other AMMs
- Can lead to significant slippage for users
- MEV (Miner Extractable Value) extraction impacts protocol fairness

## 5. Liquidity Pool Imbalance Attacks
Attacks that exploit the ratio of assets in liquidity pools to create profit opportunities.

### Attack Mechanism:
- Manipulate the ratio of tokens in a liquidity pool
- Create artificial price discrepancies
- Exploit these discrepancies for profit

### Uniswap-Specific Concerns:
- Concentrated liquidity in V3 creates new attack vectors
- Tick-based liquidity can be manipulated at range boundaries
- Impermanent loss can be amplified in certain scenarios

## 6. Governance Attacks
Many DeFi protocols, including Uniswap, use governance tokens for decision-making.

### Attack Mechanism:
- Acquire significant governance tokens
- Propose and vote for malicious changes
- Execute attacks through legitimate governance processes

### Uniswap-Specific Concerns:
- UNI token governance could be manipulated
- Flash loans might be used to temporarily acquire voting power
- Delegate voting power could be concentrated

## 7. Code Dependency Vulnerabilities
DeFi protocols often rely on external libraries and dependencies.

### Attack Mechanism:
- Exploit vulnerabilities in imported libraries
- Target dependency chains
- Compromise shared infrastructure

### Uniswap-Specific Concerns:
- Complex dependencies in Uniswap V3
- Interactions with periphery contracts
- Reliance on specific Solidity versions and compiler settings

## 8. Cross-Protocol Attacks
Attacks that exploit interactions between multiple DeFi protocols.

### Attack Mechanism:
- Identify vulnerable interactions between protocols
- Exploit assumptions made by one protocol about another
- Chain multiple exploits across protocols

### Uniswap-Specific Concerns:
- Many protocols use Uniswap as liquidity source or price oracle
- Cascading failures can originate from Uniswap exploits
- Complex integrations increase attack surface

## 9. Slippage and Price Impact Manipulation
Attacks that exploit price movements during transaction execution.

### Attack Mechanism:
- Manipulate prices between transaction submission and execution
- Force transactions to execute at unfavorable prices
- Extract value from price movements

### Uniswap-Specific Concerns:
- Concentrated liquidity can lead to higher slippage in certain ranges
- Complex slippage protection mechanisms can have edge cases
- Multi-hop swaps increase vulnerability to slippage attacks

## 10. Centralization Risks
Points of centralization in otherwise decentralized protocols.

### Attack Mechanism:
- Target centralized components
- Exploit admin privileges
- Attack centralized infrastructure

### Uniswap-Specific Concerns:
- Fee switch mechanism controlled by governance
- Protocol upgrades through governance
- Reliance on specific infrastructure providers

## Security Best Practices for Uniswap Testing

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all functions under various market conditions
2. **Invariant Testing**: Verify mathematical invariants hold under all circumstances
3. **Fuzz Testing**: Use randomized inputs to discover edge cases
4. **Simulation Testing**: Simulate real-world attack scenarios
5. **Integration Testing**: Test interactions with other protocols
6. **Economic Attack Modeling**: Model potential economic exploits
7. **Formal Verification**: Mathematically prove contract correctness where possible
8. **Gas Optimization Analysis**: Ensure functions can't be DOSed through gas limitations
9. **Access Control Verification**: Verify all privileged functions have proper access controls
10. **Event Emission Verification**: Ensure all important state changes emit appropriate events
